# Mobile apps vs. web apps: The pros and cons

## Native mobile apps

### Pros:

> 1. Faster than web apps
> 1. Greater functionality as they have access to system resources
> 1. Can work offline
> 1. Safe and secure — native apps must first be approved by the app store
> 1. Easier to build due to the availability of developer tools, interface 
elements and SDKs

### Cons:

> 1. More expensive to build than web apps
> 1. Compatibility with different platforms (i.e. iOS and Android) usually means 
designing and building the app from scratch
> 1. Expensive to maintain and update
> 1. It may prove difficult to get a native app approved by the app store

## Web apps

### Pros:

> 1. Do not need to be downloaded or installed — web apps function in-browser
> 1. Easy to maintain — they have a common codebase regardless of mobile 
platform
> 1. Will update themselves
> 1. Quicker and easier to build than mobile apps
> 1. Do not require app store approval, so can be launched quickly

### Cons:

> 1. Do not work offline
> 1. Slower than mobile apps, and less advanced in terms of features
> 1. May not be as discoverable as mobile apps as they are not listed in a 
specific database, such as the app store
> 1. Quality and security is not always guaranteed — web apps don’t need to be 
approved by the app store
