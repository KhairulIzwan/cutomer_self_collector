# Mobile apps vs. web apps: The pros and cons

## Native mobile apps

### Pros:

> 1. Faster than web apps
> 2. Greater functionality as they have access to system resources
> 3. Can work offline
> 4. Safe and secure — native apps must first be approved by the app store
> 5. Easier to build due to the availability of developer tools, interface 
elements and SDKs

### Cons:

> 1. More expensive to build than web apps
> 1. Compatibility with different platforms (i.e. iOS and Android) usually means designing and building the app from scratch
> 1. Expensive to maintain and update
> 1. It may prove difficult to get a native app approved by the app store

Web apps

Pros:

Do not need to be downloaded or installed — web apps function in-browser
Easy to maintain — they have a common codebase regardless of mobile platform
Will update themselves
Quicker and easier to build than mobile apps
Do not require app store approval, so can be launched quickly
Cons:

Do not work offline
Slower than mobile apps, and less advanced in terms of features
May not be as discoverable as mobile apps as they are not listed in a specific database, such as the app store
Quality and security is not always guaranteed — web apps don’t need to be approved by the app store
